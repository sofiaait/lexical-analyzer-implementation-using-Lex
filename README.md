# lexical-analyzer-implementation-using-Lex
This project uses the Lex tool to automatically generate a lexical analyzer in C for a mini-language. Lex simplifies building lexical analyzers by generating the scanner from a specification, reducing manual errors and effort, especially when handling many tokens. The analyzer follows the provided grammar.
